# This policy uses the Sentinel tfplan import to require that all EC2 instances
# have all mandatory tags.
# Note that the comparison is case-sensitive since AWS tags are case-sensitive.

# Import common-functions/tfplan-functions/tfplan-functions.sentinel
# with alias "plan"
import "tfplan-functions" as plan

# List of mandatory tags
### List of mandatory tags ###
mandatory_tags = [
  "Department",
  "Billable",

# Get all EC2 instances
allEC2Instances = plan.find_resources("aws_instance")

# Filter to EC2 instances with violations
# Warnings will be printed for all violations since the last parameter is true
violatingEC2Instances = plan.filter_attribute_not_contains_list(allEC2Instances,
                        "tags", mandatory_tags, true)
